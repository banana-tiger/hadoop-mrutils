# Hadoop MR Utils #

### What is this? ###

This is collection of my helper scripts for running jobs on Elastic MapReduce 
and example code to get started with Hadoop streaming and Pig jobs. I put all 
these together for a workshop at Noisebridge's Machine Learning meetup, but 
feel free to use and repurpose them for whatever you want.

### What's in here? ###

* `emr/` contains a bunch of helper scripts to spin up clusters, deploy code
to S3, and run jobs on Elastic MapReduce.
* `scripts/` contains a bunch of example code to demonstrate writing jobs using
Hadoop streaming and Pig.
